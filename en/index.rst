Upgrades
========

The IATI standard is a living entity that requires improvement over time. The elements, attributes, rules and core codelist values can only be amended, added or removed during a formal upgrade.

See :doc:`How we manage the standard <how-we-manage-the-standard>` to find out more about our upgrade processes.

See :doc:`Upgrade changelogs <upgrade-changelogs>` to find out the changes made at each upgrade.

Non-core codelists
------------------

The only part of the Standard which can be updated outside of a formal upgrade are non-core codelists :doc:`here <how-we-manage-the-standard/codelist-management>`. These codelists are not version specific and additions or modifications have minor impact on already published data.

Often these codelists are replicas of codelists managed externally. IATI will keep the codelists up to date and log all changes made to a codelist e.g. when the ISO Country Codelist updated the country name Swaziland to eSwatini.

A changelog of the non-core codelists is available :doc:`here <upgrade-changelogs/noncore-codelist-changelog>`.

See :doc:`Guidance Updates <guidance-updates>` for blah blah blah...
