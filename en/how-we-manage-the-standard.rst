The IATI standard is a living entity that will require improvement over time.

The standard is a collection of XML schema, core codelists, non-core codelists, documentation and rules.

Changes to some or all of those parts of the standard will be driven by the suggestions and experiences of the publishers and users of IATI data. Depending on what changes are being proposed, the following processes will be followed:

Upgrade process: Minor (previously decimal) upgrades can be initiated by the `Governing Board <https://iatistandard.org/en/about/governance/who-runs-iati/>`__, following advice from the TAG Chair and the Technical Lead. Major upgrades can be initiated by the `Members’ Assembly <https://iatistandard.org/en/about/join-iati/members-assembly/>`__, following the advice from the Governing Board.
The current process for upgrading the standard (details below) was agreed at the `2017 Members’ Assembly <https://iatistandard.org/documents/242/Paper-10-Proposed-revisions-to-the-IATI-Standard-upgrade-process.pdf>`__. For the previous upgrade process please see the `Previous Upgrade Process <http://iatistandard.org/upgrades/all-versions/previous-process>`__ page.

For information about different versions of the **IATI Standard** see :doc:`All versions <how-we-manage-the-standard/versions>`. 

Codelist changes: There are different types of codelist changes. Details of how the IATI codelists are managed are here (add in link).


How to get involved and suggest changes: Any member of the IATI community can make a proposal (via `IATI Discuss <https://discuss.iatistandard.org/c/standard-management>`__). Suggestions for changes and enhancements across the Standard are accepted from all stakeholders. Each proposal will be assigned to the relevant category under Stanard Management.The forums allow for a public exchange on the merits of the proposals to take place.

If you have any questions about the standard management processes, please do get in touch by emailing our Helpdesk (support@iatistandard.org)
